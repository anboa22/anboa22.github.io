Yesterday, Tbilisi witnessed a unique New Year's celebration. A group of citizens, advocating for European integration, gathered for a spontaneous meal. Notably, there were no politicians or prominent figures leading the event. This grassroots initiative beautifully demonstrated the power of collective action â€“ showing that meaningful change can be driven by ordinary people, united by a common goal, without the need for a single leader to guide them.
