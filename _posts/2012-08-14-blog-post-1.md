The independent winery industry in Georgia is refusing to be associated with the government and is actively opposing the current political climate. This stance is evident in their decision to boycott the Russian market and focus their export efforts on European countries. This situation exemplifies the intersection of place-based economies, urban/rural dynamics, and political resistance. These wineries, often characterized by decentralized production and a strong emphasis on local terroir and authenticity, utilize their economic power to express their opposition to the government's policies. By prioritizing ethical considerations and aligning themselves with the European market, they demonstrate the potential for place-based economies to embody and project social and political values. This case study raises crucial questions for urban studies, such as how place-based economies can maintain autonomy, the role of local food systems in fostering social change, and how urban centers can support rural producers prioritizing ethical and sustainable practices.
