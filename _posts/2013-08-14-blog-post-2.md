This seemingly chaotic whiteboard is my visual language for understanding and interpreting complex research data. It's a space where ideas can flow freely, connections can be made, and new insights can emerge.

As I work to structure my findings, I'm reminded of the power of visual thinking. By mapping out my ideas and visualizing the relationships between different concepts, I'm able to gain a clearer understanding of the big picture.
