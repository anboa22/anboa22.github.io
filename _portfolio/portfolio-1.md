In this project I implimented the [zoning policies Optimization Papwr](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1439742) By Otubu, T., on the integration of urban development processes. Additionally, I conducted my own research by interviewing various art organizations in Malm√∂. I used transcription tools to analyze the interviews, making the report more insightful. The comprehensive report for this project can be found [here](https://www.academia.edu/126656957/Report_Arts_and_Cities/cities-planing).
